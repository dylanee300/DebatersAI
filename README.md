# DebatersAI

DebatersAI is an open-source AI that helps you crush your school debates — it writes your speech, finds sources, makes your arguments stronger, and helps you sound way more confident. Perfect for middle and high school students who want a little extra boost when preparing for debates.

Why Open Source?

We made DebatersAI open source because learning’s way better when everyone pitches in. Students, teachers, and developers can all help improve it, add cool features, or tweak it to fit different debate styles. Plus, being open means you can see exactly how it works — no secrets here!

Note: Version 1 (v1) of DebatersAI is still in development and not officially released yet.

If you want, you can try self-hosting it now, but please be aware that there is currently no official support or help available. Use it at your own risk, and stay tuned for updates!

Feel free to use it, tinker with the code, and help make it better for everyone!
